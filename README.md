# Wordle game implemented in rust

## Description
Small program to play the Wordle game.
This project was made in about an hour to learn the Rust programming language.

## Dictionaries
I added a small french dictionary to the game. If needed, I left the script that I used to convert a .tsv file to a simple .txt file.
Word must be separated by a newline.

## TODO
 - [ ] CLI arguments:
   - [ ] -d, --dictionary (Change the selected dictionary)
   - [ ] -l, --lives (Change the number of lives)
 - [ ] Play again
 - [ ] Add a timer
 - [ ] Add a score
 - [ ] Add GUI ?
